<h1>MU Policy Expert and Physician to Explain New National Health Care Reform Law</h1>
<br />
<br />
Millions of Americans have questions about the sweeping national health care reform legislation that became law last month. The MU Center for Health Policy will provide answers at "Health Reform Explained," a presentation and discussion scheduled for noon to 1:30 p.m. Wednesday, April 28, in Acuff Auditorium at the MU School of Medicine.
<br /><br />
Center director Karen Edison, MD, will discuss various aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including:<br /><br />

<ul>
<li>What was included and what was left out</li>
<li>Timelines for when key reforms take effect</li>
<li>What has to happen for the bill to be implemented</li>
</ul>
<br /><br />

Following Edison's presentation, there will be time for discussion, questions and answers.
<br /><br />
Edison also serves as chair and Philip C. Anderson Professor of Dermatology, as well as medical director of the Missouri Telehealth Network at MU. She served as a Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellow and then majority health policy staff for the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee in the United States Senate from 1999 to 2001. It was there that she was instrumental in the legislative expansion of Medicare reimbursement for telemedicine services. She also was a key member of the legislative team that drafted the reauthorization of the Community Health Centers Program, and she spent two years as an integral staff member with the bipartisan coalition that developed the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act, which was signed into federal law in 2005.
<br /><br />
Since its inception, the MU Center for Health Policy has been responsive to trends and emergent issues in health care by providing objective analysis, education and communication. The center's activities incorporate the interests and concerns of all stakeholders and enhance ongoing awareness of the rapidly changing health care environment.
